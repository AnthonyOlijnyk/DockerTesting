This is a test script that takes an image, recolors it, and then shows the three recolors on one figure.

To use this file normally, just download the folder, cd into it in terminal and write python imageprocessing.py

You should also see four lines printed to the terminal. This was done to show the difference between how this runs
inside a container vs outside a container.
